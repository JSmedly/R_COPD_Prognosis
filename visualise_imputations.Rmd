## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

train_data <- train_data[c(preds_bin, preds_cts, preds_categ, outcome)]
train_data
```

```{r}
library(mice)

nimp <- 10
pred_mat <- make.predictorMatrix(train_data)
# pred_mat[c("height", "weight"), c("bmi", "dlco")] <- 0
meth <- make.method(train_data)
imp <- futuremice(train_data, n.core=5,
      predictorMatrix = pred_mat, method = meth,

Imputation here shows height, weight, and bmi not being properly mixed together. The other variables are all sufficiently mixed.

```{r}
# Don't apply passive imputation since BMI is no longer maintaining its ratio to weight and height

train_data %>% 
  select(weight, height, bmi) %>%
  mutate(bmi_calc = weight / height^2)

```

```{r}
# However, there is a strong correlation
library(naniar)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(train_data, 
       aes(x=weight,
           y=bmi)) +
  geom_miss_point(alpha=0.1)
ggplot(train_data, 
       aes(x=height,
           y=bmi)) +
  geom_miss_point(alpha=0.1)
ggplot(train_data, 
       aes(x=weight,
           y=height)) +
  geom_miss_point(alpha=0.1)
```
There is a strong correlation between the standardised weight and bmi. Relations with height and bmi is hard to see (1/height^2 prop BMI). Weak correlation between height and weight.
Therefore we need to remove feedback loop between weight and bmi. Also remove feedback between height and bmi.

```{r}
pred_mat[c("weight", "height"), "bmi"] <- 0
imp.pas <- futuremice(train_data, n.core=5,
      predictorMatrix = pred_mat, method = meth,
      m = 10, maxit = 20, print = FALSE
  )
```

```{r}
plot(imp.pas)
```
Weight, height and BMI now have better mixing in their chains. Check quickly the other interactions.

```{r}
ggplot(train_data, 
       aes(x=height,
           y=age)) +
  geom_miss_point(alpha=0.1)

ggplot(train_data, 
       aes(x=height,
           y=fev1)) +
  geom_miss_point(alpha=0.1)
ggplot(train_data, 
       aes(x=height,
           y=fvc)) +
  geom_miss_point(alpha=0.01)
ggplot(train_data, 
       aes(x=height,
           y=fev1_fvc)) +
  geom_miss_point(alpha=0.1)
ggplot(train_data, 
       aes(x=height,
           y=fev1_fev6)) +
  geom_miss_point(alpha=0.1)
ggplot(train_data, 
       aes(x=height,
           y=pef)) +
  geom_miss_point(alpha=0.1)
ggplot(train_data, 
       aes(x=height,
           y=mmef)) +
  geom_miss_point(alpha=0.1)
```

```{r}
ggplot(train_data, 
       aes(x=fev1,
           y=fvc)) +
  geom_miss_point(alpha=0.01)
```

```{r}
# Look at shadows in distributions

```

Examine is there a correlation between missing data and not taking certain measurements? Specifically, is age or breathlessness particularly correlated with missingness?
```{r}
ggplot(data_shadow,
       aes(x=age,
           colour = mmrc_NA)) +
  geom_density()
ggplot(data_shadow,
       aes(x=fev1_fvc,
           colour = mmrc_NA)) +
  geom_density()

ggplot(data_shadow,
       aes(x=age,
           colour = smoking_status_NA)) +
  geom_density()
ggplot(data_shadow,
       aes(x=fev1_fvc,
           colour = smoking_status_NA)) +
  geom_density()

ggplot(data_shadow,
       aes(x=age,
           colour = dlco_NA)) +
  geom_density()
ggplot(data_shadow,
       aes(x=fev1_fvc,
           colour = dlco_NA)) +
  geom_density()

ggplot(data_shadow,
       aes(x=age,
           colour = fivc_NA)) +
  geom_density()
ggplot(data_shadow,
       aes(x=fev1_fvc,
           colour = fivc_NA)) +
  geom_density()

ggplot(data_shadow,
       aes(x=age,
           colour = spo2_NA)) +
  geom_density()
ggplot(data_shadow,
       aes(x=fev1_fvc,
           colour = spo2_NA)) +
  geom_density()
ggplot(data_shadow,
       aes(x=decades_from_start,
           colour = spo2_NA)) +
  geom_density()

ggplot(data_shadow,
       aes(x=age,
           colour = pef_NA)) +
  geom_density()
ggplot(data_shadow,
       aes(x=fev1_fvc,
           colour = pef_NA)) +
  geom_density()

ggplot(data_shadow,
       aes(x=age,
           colour = mmef_NA)) +
  geom_density()
ggplot(data_shadow,
       aes(x=fev1_fvc,
           colour = mmef_NA)) +
  geom_density()

```
For mmrc, smoking status, dlco, and fivc, we see a fairly unbiased relationship between age and fev1_fvc (representative of disease severity). However, the expriatory flow tests (PEF and MMEF) both have different missing data distributions. 
PEF has a higher proportion of missing values at mid-high FEV1/FVC values, and no missing at low FEV1_FVC. Similarly, PEF has little missingness at older ages, but most of its missing values are for younger patients.
Inversely, MMEF is mostly missing its values around slightly below average values for FEV1_FVC, and around the mean age (whereas older or younger patients are having their MMEF measured).
HOWEVER, these are both because of their incredibly small pct missingness (random correlations). This can be seen through use of the histogram

```{r}
ggplot(data_shadow,
       aes(x=fev1_fvc,
           fill = mmef_NA)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

We now look at the density plots for the imputed chains.

```{r}
densityplot(imp.pas)
```
PEF and MMEF both are noisier, coming from their imputed chains consisting of a very small number of values from which to create a density plot.
SPo2 imputations are discrete and plotting their densities is not a good visual representation. The other plots are all good, however. FIVC and DLCO with the most missing values are very tight fits to the original distributions.

We also can note that height, weight, bmi, fivc, pef, and dlco are all easily modelled with gaussians, so we can change the method.

```{r}
meth_orig <- make.method(train_data)
meth_fast <- meth_orig
meth_fast[c("height", "weight", "bmi", "fivc", "pef", "dlco")] <- "norm"

start.time <- Sys.time()
futuremice(train_data, n.core=5,
      predictorMatrix = pred_mat, method = meth_orig,
      m = nimp, maxit = 20, print = FALSE
  ) 
end.time <- Sys.time()
time.taken <- end.time - start.time
print(time.taken)

start.time <- Sys.time()
futuremice(train_data, n.core=5,
      predictorMatrix = pred_mat, method = meth_fast,
      m = nimp, maxit = 20, print = FALSE
  ) 
end.time <- Sys.time()
time.taken <- end.time - start.time
print(time.taken)

```
There is no notable speedup, so continue to use pmm.


```{r}

fit <- with(imp, glm(ici(imp) ~ age + height + weight + bmi + sex + fev1 + fvc + fivc + fev1_fvc + fev1_fev6 + pef + mmef + dlco + spo2 + smoking_status + mmrc, family=binomial))
ps <- rep(rowMeans(sapply(fit$analyses, fitted.values)), imp$m + 1)

# stripplot(imp.pas,data=mmef)

# Use some different methods of plotting spo2 to examine how well it has been imputed.
# SpO2 against probability of data being missing
xyplot(imp.pas, spo2 ~ ps | as.factor(.imp), alpha=0.05)
# SpO2 against severity
xyplot(imp.pas, spo2 ~ fev1_fvc | as.factor(.imp), alpha=0.05)
# Trying to increase distance spread of spo2
xyplot(imp.pas, age~spo2 | as.factor(.imp), na.groups=spo2, cex=c(0.5, 0.1), alpha=0.05)
xyplot(imp.pas, fev1_fvc~spo2 | as.factor(.imp), na.groups=spo2, cex=c(0.5, 0.2), alpha=c(0.05,0.05))
# Box and whiskers plot for each imputation
bwplot(imp.pas, data=spo2)
# Density plot again
densityplot(imp.pas, ~ spo2)
```
One of the biggest perceived issues is that spo2 has many missing values that get imputed around the lower values for spo2. However, this is just a visualisation issue where it's hard to measure the relative densities. 80% of spo2 is missing, so it needs lots of imputations.


Overall, all imputations look appropriate.
```{r}
imp.comp <- complete(imp.pas, "long")
imp.comp
```

```{r}
#We can quickly fit models to this and assess normality of residuals for predictors
modelFit1 <- glm(data=imp.comp%>%filter(.imp==1), formula=hosp_5_year ~ hosp_past_year + sex + age + height + weight + bmi + fev1 + fvc + fev1_fvc + exp(spo2+101) + mmef + pef + dlco + mmrc + smoking_status, family="binomial")
summary(modelFit1)
plot(modelFit1)
anova(modelFit1, test="Chisq")
```

```{r}
res <- residuals(modelFit1, type="deviance")
plot(log(predict(modelFit1)), res)
abline(h=0, lty=2)
qqnorm(res)
qqline(res)
```

```{r}
# Tasks to do
